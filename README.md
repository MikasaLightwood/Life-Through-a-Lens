## About the Project

**Life Through a Lens** is a personal photography portfolio website created to showcase my unique perspective as a photographer. The site highlights how I capture the world â€” vibrant, honest, and deeply human â€” through portraits, landscapes, and candid moments that tell authentic stories.

The project consists of four main sections:

* **Home Page:** A welcoming introduction to the portfolio.
* **About Page:** A personal biography section with a photo and background about my journey as a photographer.
* **Gallery Page:** A curated collection of favorite photos, displayed in a visually engaging layout.
* **Contact Page:** A simple form and details for connecting, styled with a background image for added visual appeal.

The website is styled entirely with a custom **CSS stylesheet**, making use of selectors, the box model, background colors and images, borders, font styles, and responsive rules to ensure a polished and professional appearance.

This project also demonstrates my ability to use **Git and GitHub** effectively, with multiple commits, version control, and successful deployment through **GitHub Pages**, making the portfolio accessible to anyone with the live link.
